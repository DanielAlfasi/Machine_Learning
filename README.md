# Machine Learning from Data - Course Projects

This repository contains my project submissions for the Machine Learning from Data course. These projects provide hands-on experience with various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Introduction

The Machine Learning from Data course provides a comprehensive introduction to the main techniques and concepts of machine learning. As part of the coursework, we have implemented and compared different algorithms on real-world datasets.

## Projects

Here are the projects completed so far:

1. **Project 1:** Linear Regression for House Pricing Prediction 
   - Implemented linear regression with gradient descent to predict house prices.
   
2. **Project 2:** Decision Trees for Mushroom Classification
   - Used decision trees to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.

3. **Project 3:** Naive Bayes and Discrete Bayes for Classification
   - Implemented and compared the performance of Naive Bayes and Discrete Bayes classifiers.

## Installation

To run these projects, ensure you have the required software installed:

- Python 3.6 or above
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

-pip install numpy pandas
